**_Requirements of Project_**

- Use a modern framework like React
  - Used React
- Create an application that can be interacted with in a minimum of three different ways
  - Users can browse, create projects, edit those projects, and back other projects
- Use an architectural pattern
  - Tried my hardest to stick to MCV, but I am still mastering using it in a React environment
- Integrate with a backend service you developed with CRUD operations
  - User has full CRUD operations
- Integrate a 3rd party RESTful API
  - Missed this one! Ran out of time on integrating with Stripe, which I am very bummed about. I have the slot it should go in but didn't make it in time.
- Use at least 5 UI components from material-ui
  - Used 5 or 6 throughout--really surprised by how amazingly easy material-ui is to work with, I will definitely be using it in future for personal projects
- An example of a reusable component you created and used in the app
  - The main one was the ProjectCard component. I used it in several places.
